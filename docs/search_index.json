Susan Lord, Matthew Ohland, Marisa Orr, Richard Layton, and Russell Long 2021 Frontiers in Education (FIE) Conference (Oct 13, 2021) 1 Introduction 1.1 Objectives MIDFIELDas of May 1, 2021contains individual Student Unit Record (SUR) data for 1.7 M undergraduates at 19 institutions with ABET-accredited engineering programs. Of those, 302,631 students declared engineering as a major at some point in their undergraduate education. MIDFIELD is a comprehensive resource that includes demographic, enrollment, course performance, and graduation data. A total of 33 institutions have completed Memoranda of Understanding and are expected to be included in the next release. At the conclusion of the session, participants should be able to: describe MIDFIELD and the data it contains describe student record data describe some key research results that have been obtained using MIDFIELD determine if MIDFIELD would be useful for their research outline process to access MIDFIELD plan for future workshops if interested in learning more about MIDFIELD 1.2 Description This special session introduces participants to the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD). MIDFIELD includes longitudinal, whole population data for multiple institutions. This enables researchers to examine student characteristics such as race/ethnicity, sex, or age and curricular pathways,including coursework, by institution and over time. Because the data set contains records of all students matriculating over a period of time, researchers can study students in all disciplines, not just engineering. 1.3 Agenda Min Topic 10 Session introduction 15 Key research results usng MIDFIELD 35 Finding stories in the data 25 Resources to facilitate use of MIDFIELD 5 Wrap-up 1.4 Facilitators Susan Lord Director of the MIDFIELD Institute and Professor and Chair of Integrated Engineering at the University of San Diego.
