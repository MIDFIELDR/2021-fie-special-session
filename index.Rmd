## Objectives 

[**MIDFIELD**](https://engineering.purdue.edu/MIDFIELD){target="_blank"}---as of May 1, 2021---contains individual Student Unit Record (SUR) data for 1.7 M undergraduates at 19 institutions with ABET-accredited engineering programs. Of those, 302,631 students declared engineering as a major at some point in their undergraduate education. MIDFIELD is a comprehensive resource that includes  demographic, enrollment, course performance, and graduation data. A total of 33 institutions have completed Memoranda of Understanding and are expected to be included in the next release.

At the conclusion of the session, participants should be able
to: 


- describe MIDFIELD and the data it contains
- describe student record data
- describe some key research results that have been obtained using MIDFIELD
- determine if MIDFIELD would be useful for their research
- outline process to access MIDFIELD
- plan for future workshops if interested in learning more about MIDFIELD





## Description 

This special session introduces participants to the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD). MIDFIELD includes longitudinal, whole population data for multiple institutions. This enables researchers to examine student characteristics such as race/ethnicity, sex, or age and curricular pathways,including coursework, by institution and over time. Because the data set contains records of all students matriculating over a period of time, researchers can study students in all disciplines, not just engineering.
